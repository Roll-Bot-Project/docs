description: Use a reminder to notify the drawing of a message
---

# Introduction

## Default Reminder

The default reminder will be set for the `defaultReminds` item in the settings when creating the prize.

## Reminder message push range

The push range for reminders will be the same as for a drawing of rewards by default and will be synchronized with the drawing

You can specify the push range of reminders. The range of reminders will no longer be synced dynamically when specified.

Note that reminders can only be sent within the open range of their prizes.

## Visible range of reminders

In order to avoid excessive information disruption, when a reminder is created, you can only query the alarm you created yourself.

But the number of reminders is the only global one, and you can use them anywhere else.

## Supported alarm types

### Timed reminders

Reminder at specified time

### Alert before end

Notify at the specified time before the end of the drawing

### Reminder interval

Notify after each time interval
