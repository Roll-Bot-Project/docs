# Before Start

## Commands too long?

Most commands have one or more alias, and you can find them in the **Localization & Alias** part of the command page.For example, '/roll' can be replaced by shorter `/r` and `/remoind` can be replaced by `/rd`.Most of the commands also provide alias for multilingualism.

## Internationalization

Maybe you are using another time zone or another language, don't worry!You can [set your time zone](i18n/user-timezone.md) and [language prefer](i18n/user-language-preference.md).

## I am a qq guild user, what is the channel?

For qq, a guild contains only one channel and can therefore be considered equivalent.The channel id is the same as the guild number at this time.

But for some platforms (e.g. discord), there may be multiple channels within a guild.So you may need to [get current channel ID](basic/get-channel-id.md).
