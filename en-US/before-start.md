# Before Start

## Internationalization

Maybe you are using another time zone or another language, don't worry!You can[设置你使用的时区](i18n/user-timezone.md) and[语言偏好](i18n/user-language-preference.md)

## I am a qq group user, what is the channel?

For qq, a group contains only one channel and can therefore be considered equivalent.The channel id is the same as the group number at this time.

But for some platforms (e.g. discord), there may be multiple channels within a group.So you may need[通过指令获取你当前的频道id](basic/get-channel-id.md).
